This file is used for the sake of copying, as it is always a good thing to
make a testfile.txt and put a letter or anything in it u don't wanna save and
then copy the files over to the opencomputers directory after exiting
to main menu in minecraft. If the test file says this after reloading, then
you have the official files

Always get the files from https://github.com/melanchol69/VEB-For-Banks and
nowhere else.
