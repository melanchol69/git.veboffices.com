--------------------------------------------------
This program comes with the option for security,
there is a passcode option in the setup which
allows you to set a passcode on the program for it
to run. This defaults to off for functionality,
after all, you don't want the program to fail
because you don't know the passcode. If you wish
for further security measures, there will be a
new version of VEB For Banks that supports data
cards and can encrypt files.
